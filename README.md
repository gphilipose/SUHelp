# SUHelp

## Inspiration
Our Inspiration is providing a good place for all Seattle U resources to promote accessibility

What it does
## We put as many resources as we could find into an easy to navigate tabs. 

## How we built it
We built it using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, SQL, MySQL, and Git

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into some planning issues and pivoted our approach to the project midway, but it led to a product that has the functionalities we wanted. We realized that the goal of our project should be a more interactive website that allows anonymous student feedback to improve the services we already have. We overcame issues with connecting to the database using PHP and MySQL.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the quick summaries and the utilization of tooltips, the review sections for each tab, the website feedback page, and the search function.

## What we learned
We learned just how many resources there really are on campus, how to improve our PHP skills, and how to delegate tasks as a team and solve issues dynamically. 

## What's next for SU Help
We want to further link our website to our database, allowing for more dynamic addition and removal of resources. We also want to turn our website into an app to be more accessible to SU students.
